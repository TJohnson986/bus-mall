LAB - Bus Mall

This lab taught me how to use chartjs, local storage, event listeners, etc. It shows 3 products at a time and logs the number of views and clicks, then shows the data in a chart. The data continues to be stored in local storage so that the data grows.

Reflections and Comments
This was a very neat lab! I liked being able to think though some more complex logic and use tools like chartjs and local storage.
